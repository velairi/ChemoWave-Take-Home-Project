# ChemoWave Take-Home Project

Create an app that displays Reddit top posts, and display comments upon user clicking a post.

What I have so far:
- A working implementation of an app that displays the top Reddit posts and all the top level comments for that post.
- Refactored to MVVM design pattern
- Added unit tests

What I would like to accomplish next:
- Make the UI more user friendly
