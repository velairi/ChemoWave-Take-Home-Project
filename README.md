# ChemoWave Take-Home Project

Create an app that displays Reddit top posts, and display comments upon user clicking a post.

What I have so far:
- A working implementation of an app that displays the top Reddit posts and when user clicks on a post, it will take them to all the top level comments for that post.

What I would like to accomplish next:
- In the process of refactoring to MVVM design pattern
- Make the UI more user friendly
- Unit test View Models and Models
